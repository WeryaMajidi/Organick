### :page_facing_up: About

Organic Agricultural Products Online Shop Landing Page This is a **fully responsive** landing page for an online shop that sells organic agricultural products. The page was developed using **HTML**, **Sass**, and **JavaScript**. This page was developed based on a Figma design that you can see [**Here**](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1202913967893500741) which was not responsive and I made it responsive by myself.
