### 📄 About:

Organic Agricultural Products Online Shop Landing Page This is a fully responsive landing page for an online shop that sells organic agricultural products. The page was developed using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. This page was developed based on a Figma design that you can see [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1202913967893500741) which was not responsive and I made it responsive by myself.

**Features**

- Fully responsive design

- Built with HTML, Sass, and JavaScript
